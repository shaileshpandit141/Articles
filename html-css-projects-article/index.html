                    it comes to stepping into the
                    programming world most of the people start with the easiest thing <span>HTML</span> and
                    <span>CSS</span> Every beginner's coding journey in frontend starts with these two basic
                    building blocks and you need to be creative when it comes to designing a beautiful application.

                    adding images, working with layout and a lot
                    of cool stuff in web designing but when it comes to making a project using only <span>HTML</span>
                    and <span>CSS</span> they
                    get
                    stuck and confuse about what they should make to practice all these stuff. Afterall their knowledge
                    is
                    just limited to <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. No matter what after learning everything at
                    some point you will
                    realize
                    that making a project is important to practice <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> skills. You
                    need to check how <span>HTML</span> and
                    <span>CSS</span>
                    work together to design a beautiful frontend application. So the question is what are some
                    beginner-friendly projects you can build to practice everything you have learnedâ€¦Let's discuss that.

                <h3>1. A Tribute Page</h3>
                <p>The simplest website you can make as a beginner is a tribute page of someone you admire in your life.
                    It requires only basic knowledge of <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. Make a webpage writing
                    about that person adding
                    his/her image. On the top of the webpage, add the image and name of the person and below that give
                    layout for the rest of the details. You can use paragraphs, lists, links, images with
                    <span>CSS</span> to give it
                    a descent look. Add a suitable background color and font style on your webpage. Most of the parts
                    you can make using <span>HTML</span> but to give it a better look using a bit of <span>CSS</span>.
                    Take help from the link

                <h3>2. Webpage Including Form</h3>
                <p>Forms are always an essential part of any project and you will be working with a lot of forms in most
                    of the applications so why not practice it earlier and test your knowledge. Once you get familiar
                    with the input field or basic tags in <span>HTML</span> to create a form make a project using all
                    those tags. How
                    to use a text field, checkbox, radio button, date, and other important elements in a single form.
                    You will be learning how to give a proper structure to a webpage while creating a form. Knowledge of
                    <span>HTML</span>/<span>HTML5</span> is good enough but you can use a bit of <span>CSS</span> to
                    make the project look better. Take help
                    from the links given below.

                <h3>3. Parallax Website</h3>
                <p>A parallax website includes fixed images in the background that you can keep in place and you can
                    scroll down the page to see different parts of the image. With basic knowledge of <span>HTML</span>
                    and <span>CSS</span>, you
                    can give a parallax effect to a website. Using the parallax effect in web designing is really
                    popular and it gives beautiful look and feels to the webpage. Give it a try and divide the whole
                    page into three to four different sections. Set 3-4 background images, align the text for different
                    sections, set margin and padding, add background-position and other <span>CSS</span> elements and
                    properties to
                    create a parallax effect. You can take help from the link given below.

                <h3>4. Landing Page</h3>
                <p>A landing page is another good project you can make using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> but
                    it requires a solid
                    knowledge of these two building blocks. You will be using lots of creativity while making a landing
                    page. You will practice how to add footer and header, create columns, align-items, divide the
                    sections and a lot of things. You will have to use <span>CSS</span> carefully keeping in mind that
                    different
                    elements do not overlap with each other. You will also take care of color combinations, padding,
                    margin, space between sections, paragraphs, and boxes. Color combinations should go well with each
                    other for different sections or backgrounds.

                    for a restaurant. Making a
                    layout for a restaurant will be a bit complicated than previous project examples. You will be
                    aligning the different food items and drinks using a <span>CSS</span> layout grid. You will be
                    adding prices,
                    images and you need to give it a beautiful look and feel as well using the proper combination of
                    colors, font-style and images. You can add pictures gallery for different food items, you can also
                    add sliding images for a better look. Add links for redirection to internal pages. Make it
                    responsive setting a viewport, using media queries and grid. You can take help from the link given

                    your web page. It requires <span>HTML</span>/<span>HTML5</span> and <span>CSS</span> knowledge in

                <h3>10. Technical Documentation</h3>
                <p>If you have a little bit of knowledge of Javascript then you can create a webpage of technical
                    documentation. It requires knowledge of <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and basic javascript.
                    Divide the whole webpage
                    into two sections. The left side creates a menu with all the topics listed from top to bottom. Right
                    side you need to mention the documentation or description for the topics. The idea is once you click
                    on one of the topics in the left section it should load the content on the right. For click, you can
                    use either javascript or <span>CSS</span> bookmark option. You don't need to make it too fancy, just
                    give it a
                    simple and descent look, that looks good for technical documentation. You can take help from the
                    links given below.
